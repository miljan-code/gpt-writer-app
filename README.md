# GPT Writer

This repo is redesigned version of my older repo [Easy-Copy](https://github.com/miljan-code/easy-copy)

GPT Writer is my first Software as a Service project. It uses Open AI's GPT-3.5 API to query prompts and transforms them into a bunch of useful services such as grammar checker, text summarizer, article writer, and paraphraser.
